# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
A simple program that recognises number gestures using color-based tracking and convexity defects

The gestures are performed using a coloured glove (orange color) which is tracked using HSV color mapping. The program makes use of the
system's webcam to detect gestures. Once the hand has been outlined, a convex hull is constructed for the same and the number of convexity
defects is determined. This program also simulates a Rock-Paper-Scissors game by considering 2 and 3 as scissors, 4 and 5 as paper and 0,1
as rock.
